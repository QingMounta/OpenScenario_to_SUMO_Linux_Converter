# Build esmini - quick guide

Supported systems: Windows, Linux and Mac.

Make sure you have a C++ compiler and CMake installed.

On Windows Visual Studio is recommended (Community/free version is good enough for building esmini). Make sure to check the "Desktop development with C++" package for installation, no more is needed.

Now weâ€™re ready to build esmini. From esmini root folder:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```
The build process automatically downloads 3rd party library binaries and the complete 3D model package.

After successful build, the binaries will be copied into esmini/bin folder. Try from command line:
```sh
./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc
```
