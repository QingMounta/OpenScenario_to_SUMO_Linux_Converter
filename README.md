[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)


Make sure you have a C++ compiler and CMake installed.  

On Windows Visual Studio is recommended (Community/free version is good enough for building esmini). Make sure to check the "C/C++" and "CMake" packages for installation, no more is needed.  

Now weâ€™re ready to build esmini. From esmini-(version) root folder:  

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```
The build process automatically downloads 3rd party library binaries and the complete 3D model package.  

After a successful build, the binaries will be copied into esmini-(version)/bin folder. Try from the command line:  
```sh
./bin/esmini --window 60 60 800 400 --osc ./resources/xosc/cut-in.xosc
```
